# v1.2.1 - ⚡ - (A bit) Better UX!

- Better design for tree-view explorer.
- Now the tree listen to changes made on the store and on firebase, that means that when
  you create a folder or an article it will update automatically.
- Now it pre-loads the first level of the folder structure when you open the page so you don't
  need to wait while it loads when you click a folder anymore, I hope.
- Now with persistent tree state, meaning when you click an article inside a folder and go back,
  it now stores how the tree was when you left and restores it when you get back.

## Bugfix
- prevent console error if user cancel prompt in folder creation.
