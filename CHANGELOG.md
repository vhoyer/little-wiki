# v1.2.0 [in progress]

- Better design for tree-view explorer.
- Now the tree listen to changes made on the store and on firebase, that means that when
  you create a folder or an article it will update automatically.
- Now it pre-loads the first level of the folder structure when you open the page so you don't
  need to wait while it loads when you click a folder anymore, I hope.

## Bugfix
- prevent console error if user cancel prompt in folder creation


# v1.1.0

- Better navigate through out the pages with navigational buttons
- Better looks to existing buttons on the ui
- Function to delete your articles in the edit page

# v1.0.0
